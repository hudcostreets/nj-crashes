# Fargate entrypoint: run dvx, then push the regenerated `.dvc`s back as ONE
# commit.
#
# Why one commit at the end (not `dvx run --commit --push each`): the reproc
# runs the whole DAG with level-parallelism, so per-stage `git commit`/`git
# push` race — concurrent pushes to the results branch get "cannot lock ref …
# is at X but expected Y" and the losing stages' commits never escape. Instead
# we run dvx with `--no-commit` (it still *writes* the updated `.dvc` md5s into
# the worktree — it just doesn't commit them), and after the parallel run
# finishes we `git add -u && commit && push` once. No concurrency, no races,
# and the whole regenerated `.dvc` set lands as a single reviewable commit.
#
# Token arrives as $FARGATE_GITHUB_RW_TOKEN (AWS Batch injects it from Secrets
# Manager); absent it, we run read-only. Targets: Batch caps containerOverrides
# at 8192 bytes and the ~160-path list nears that, so the submit command is
# flags-only and we append `batch/reproc-targets` here.

# Audit mode: run the reproducibility audit instead of a reproc. No git
# push-back, no dvx orchestration — `reproc-audit` pins each stage's committed
# deps and re-runs its cmd itself, then classifies produced-vs-baseline. Used
# to characterize determinism / x86-vs-arm64 arch-invariance of the daily
# stages (see specs discussion). Invoked as `audit [targets...]`.
